    "infoHowItWorksTitle": "How This Site Works",
    "infoHowItWorksPara1": "This web application allows you to download audio/video from YouTube, YouTube Music, SoundCloud or other videos/tracks or playlists. You simply paste the URL, choose your desired format (MP3, M4A, Opus or MP4), and the server-side script processes your request.",
    "infoHowItWorksPara2": "The backend uses the powerful <code>yt-dlp</code> library to fetch content information and extract the audio/video stream. If MP3, M4A, Opus or MP4 format is selected, <code>ffmpeg</code> is used for conversion and to embed metadata.",
    "infoHowItWorksPara3": "The downloaded file is temporarily stored on the server and then made available for you to download directly through your browser. After the download is served to you, the file is automatically deleted from the server to save space and ensure privacy.",

    "infoLibFlask": "<strong>Flask:</strong> A micro web framework for Python, used to build the backend API.",

    "infoLibFFmpeg": "<strong>FFmpeg:</strong> A complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. Used here for format conversion (to MP3/M4A/Opus/MP4) and metadata embedding.",
    "infoLibTailwind": "<strong>Tailwind CSS:</strong> A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.",
    "infoLibJS": "<strong>JavaScript:</strong> Used for frontend interactivity, language switching, animations, and communication with the backend API.",
    "infoPythonCodeTitle": "Python Backend Code",
    "infoPythonCodePara": "The core backend logic is written in Python using the Flask framework. The Python script (typically named <code>app.py</code>) handles API requests, interacts with <code>yt-dlp</code> and <code>ffmpeg</code>, manages temporary file storage, and serves the files. This code runs on the server and is not directly visible here, but it ensures the functionality of the downloader.",
